# firstcode
Lets explore our first code on Github.
So I am quite new to all this coding stuff and to be honest, I am not quite good in it. Not even if I will get any placement at all lol.
Trying to do some things on this website.
Watching Apna College's video on YouTube to learn about GitHub.
I hope I learn something! atleast one day I will be an ExpertoftheExperts!
Thanks for Reading. I am Adhyan Dua and this is ExpertoftheExperts! Till then, keep coding, I guess!
